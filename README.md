## Project Status

**_This project's code base is still under development and breaking changes will happen. Whilst the maintainers will do our best to minimise disruption to existing deployments, this may not always be possible. Stable releases will be published when the project is more mature._**

## Background

Every architecture starts with a diagram.

But then we are quickly submerged by Azure complexity : template language and tool diversity.

This project intends to put back diagram as the core representation of everything you will achieve in Azure
